This is a demo project that showcases how to use [Pinax's TokenAPI](https://pinax.network/en/products/api) to fetch transfers and display them as fish in an aquarium.

Don't forget you might need to switch branches! 
- For Solana `git checkout solana` 

## Running the project locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Running the live demo

Switch to the `live-demo` branch which already has transfers coded in, and then add your JWT API key from
[TheGraph Market](https://thegraph.market/dashboard) to the `.env` file.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
